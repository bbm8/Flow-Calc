# Flow-Calc
Flow Calc - Compressible Gas Flow Calculator/Simulator (April 2017)

Flow Calc utilizes the Weymouth Equation to compute gas flow rates through a pipe network assuming a compressibility factor equal to 1. 

Features:
- Flow rate calculations
- Inlet pressure calculations
- Outlet pressure calculations
- Ability to design pipe network
- Large range of pipe sizes and schedules
- Variety of gasses to choose from

All calculations are approximations and Flow Calc can not be held liable for any user-created mistakes.
