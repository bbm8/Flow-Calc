# Flow-Calc
Flow Calc - Compressible Gas Flow Calculator/Simulator (April 2017)
Developed by Vikram Mullick

Flow Calc utilizes the Weymouth Equation to compute gas flow rates through a pipe network assuming a compressibility factor equal to 1. 

Features:
- Flow Rate Calculations
- Inlet Pressure Calculations
- Outlet Pressure Calculations
- Ability to Design Pipe Network
- Large Range of Pipe Sizes and Schedules
- Variety of Gasses to Choose From

All calculations are approximations and Flow Calc can not be held liable for any user-created mistakes.
